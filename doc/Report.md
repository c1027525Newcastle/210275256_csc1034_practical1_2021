#GitHub
GitHub is by far one of the most useful tools we have. I found myself using the cloning function a lot 
when I had to update my code on the university computer or the laptop I use at home. 

#Python
One of the most challenging parts of this project was the part where I had to search what different libraries
I needed did as it was the first time I done this but by just searching on the internet I came across a lot 
of good sites such as stackoverflow or different discussion sites where people asked different questions
about their program and it helped me with what I was doing. My past experience with python helped me to
better understand errors as I already had an idea what different errors refer to and was already used
to reading them so I had an easier time with finding my errors and fixing them.

#Markdown
Markdown is a very useful tool as it is very simple in terms of how you write as compared to another
notes app like Word as your choice of how to write is more limited. It is also good as it is feature
proof as it does not matter what changes you are making to the rest of the project; the markdown will
always be there.

#GitBash
I found Git Bash not that usefull as I got used to the push and commits of pycharm pretty quickly thus
I haven’t used it that much but I can see its usefulness when I was unsure of what I changed and haven’t
commited.

#Sound
For the sound file I found the pygame DLL to be the best. I had to make an mp3 file out of a song and then 
edit it in order to fit the file size required by pygame.
